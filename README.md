This data set includes three consecutive years of mortality rates of hatchery juvenille chinook. Each year, juvenille chinook in seperatec populations of different densities were analyzed.

Do higher densities of juvenille chinook salmon lead to higher mortallity rates?


I plan to determine this by finding the average mortallity percentage per density (low,medium,high) for each of the three years.
